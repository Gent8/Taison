# Taison

Taison is a personal fork of [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon), the open source manga reader for Android.  It keeps pace with upstream while experimenting with quality-of-life tweaks and a refreshed visual identity.

## Taison Highlights

- **Library navigation** – category tabs are hidden by default, replaced with a quick category dropdown inside the toolbar. Tabs can still be re-enabled in settings.
- **History scoping** – History entries are limited to the active library category from *Settings › Library › Categories*. This option can also be turned off in settings.
- **Sunrise look** – a new warm Taison default theme; the legacy blue palette lives on as *Classic Blue*.
