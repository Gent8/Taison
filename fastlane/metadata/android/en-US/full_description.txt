Taison is a fork of Mihon, the open source manga reader for Android. It keeps pace with upstream while adding polished quality-of-life upgrades, each chosen to give you more control and oversight without weighing down the interface.

• Library navigation – Category tabs are hidden by default in favor of a quick toolbar dropdown, and you can switch back to tabs.
• History scoping –  Library entries are scoped to their respective categories. The History tab includes its own category navigation, and the active category stays in sync between Library and History.
• Taison look – A distinct, warm palette unique to this fork.

More Taison features:

• History category navigation mirrors the Library tabs/dropdown, syncing category changes across both screens.
• A History “eye” toggle exposes or hides entries that sit outside your library, entry deletion can now target the current category or do a complete deletion.
• Routine upstream syncs keep Taison aligned with Mihon fixes, each changelog highlights new fork-specific polishes so you can keep up to date with Taison's progress.
